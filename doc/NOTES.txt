- Added a "rank" option to startup options to launch individual Interceptor processes
without MPI; rank of 0 launches Collector, any other rank launches a worker (unless the
broker option is selected, and then rank 1 launches Connector)

- Added "host" and "hostfile" options to run MPI on a different host, but that's not
working very well
