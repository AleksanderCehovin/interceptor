02.26.2021 - processing speed limit; fixed tests

- added processing speed limit
    - if indexing is turned on, it will only work below the selected exposure time
    cutoff
    - added exposure_time_cutoff option to startup.cfg (default = 0.1s)
    - i.e. if collecting faster than 10 Hz, will only use spotfinding even if indexing
    is selected

- added logic that will bypass the finding and addition of special keys (and values) if
custom_keys is None

- fixed all tests to work with all of the changes accumulated since last year
